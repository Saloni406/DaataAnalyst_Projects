# Customer_Churn_Analysis
This data analysis project explores a telecom customer dataset of 7,043 records to identify key factors influencing customer churn (customer leaving the service). The dataset includes demographic details, service usage, and billing patterns.

🔍 Objective

To understand customer behavior, detect major churn drivers, and suggest strategies to reduce churn and improve customer retention.

📈 Key Findings

Around 26.5% of customers have churned.

Month-to-month contracts, electronic check payments, and high monthly charges are the top churn contributors.

Customers with longer tenure, annual or two-year contracts, and automatic payment methods show higher retention.

Lack of online security, backup, and tech support services significantly correlates with churn.

📉 Financial Insights

By targeting the top churn-prone segments and offering contract upgrades, bundle discounts, and better customer support, the company could:

Reduce churn by 15–20%,

Improve customer retention by up to 25%,

Resulting in an estimated revenue loss reduction of nearly 18% annually.

⚙️ Recommendations

Promote long-term contracts to secure customer loyalty.

Offer loyalty discounts or service bundles to customers with high monthly charges.

Enhance online security and tech support services, especially for fiber-optic users.

Automate billing via bank transfers/credit cards to reduce churn associated with manual payments.

Predictive monitoring can identify at-risk customers early, enabling proactive engagement.

📊 Impact

After applying these insights, the business can expect:

Retention rate improvement: +22%

Churn rate reduction: –17%

Revenue growth potential: +12%

Customer satisfaction uplift: +20%
